        <h2>How to Make Mexican Pizza</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this homemade Mexican pizza recipe:
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the beef with onions and garlic, drain, and season.</li>
            <li>Place a tortilla on each pie plate and top with refried beans.</li>
            <li>Cover with the beef, top with another tortilla, and bake until the tortillas are crisp. </li>
            <li>Layer the toppings in this order: Salsa, cheeses, tomatoes, green onions, and jalapeño. </li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted. Cool, then cut each pizza into four slices. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Mexican Pizza Toppings and Filling</h2>
        <p>
            This copycat Mexican recipe is filled with seasoned ground beef and refried beans. The pizzas are topped
            with
            layers of salsa, Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses, tomatoes, green onion and jalapeño slices.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Store Mexican Pizza</h2>
        <p>
            These homemade Mexican pizzas are best served immediately so the tortillas stay crisp. However, if you have
            leftovers, you can wrap them in foil (or place them in an airtight container) and store them in the fridge
            for up to two days. Reheat in the oven.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>

            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>

            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>

            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>

            <li>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>

            <li>½ cup salsa</li>

            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

            <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>

            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>

            <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>

            <li>¼ cup thinly sliced jalapeño pepper</li>

            <li>¼ cup sour cream (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned
                and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika,
                salt, and pepper.
            </li>

            <li>
                Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned
                ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until
                tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top
                tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes,
                1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.
            </li>

            <li>
                Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool
                slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces.
            </li>
        </ol>
