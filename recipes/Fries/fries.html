        <h3>The Key to Crispy Homemade French Fries</h3>
        <p>
            Begin by soaking the sliced potato strips in a bowl of water for about 30 minutes to draw out the starch —
            this ensures the most deliciously crispy results. Pat potatoes dry, then add them to a pot of preheated oil
            and fry for five minutes.
            <br><br>
            Allow the potatoes to cool before frying them a second time. Let cook until golden brown, then blot with a
            paper towel and salt before serving. Double-frying guarantees a wonderful crunch that will keep you coming
            back for more.

        <h2>How to Store Homemade French Fries</h2>
        <p>
            Give french fries a longer shelf by placing them in a shallow airtight container and refrigerating for 3-5 days. Allow them to fully cool before chilling — warm fries will create steam in the container and make for soggy strips. Reheat in the oven or in a skillet to maintain a fresh, crispy flavor.
        </p>
        <h2>Can You Freeze Homemade French Fries?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, cooked french fries can be safely frozen for 10-12 months. Be sure to wrap leftovers securely in foil, freezer wrap, or a freezer-safe bag. No need to thaw — simply place frozen fries in the oven to reheat.
