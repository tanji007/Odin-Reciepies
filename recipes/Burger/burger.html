        <h2>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step
            instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:

            Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread
            crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for
            six to eight minutes per side.

            Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top
            with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.

        <h2>How to Store Beef Burgers</h2>
        <p>
            Cooked beef burgers can be safely refrigerated for three to four days. Make sure to promptly chill after
            cooking in an airtight container to lengthen shelf life.
        </p>
        <h2>Can I Freeze Basic Beef Burgers?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, you can freeze cooked burger patties for up to four months. Wrap the burgers in foil individually to
            discourage sticking before labeling and placing them in a freezer-safe bag.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
            </li>

            <li>
                Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.
            </li>

            <li>
                Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

                Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An
                instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
